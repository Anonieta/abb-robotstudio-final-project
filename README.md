# ABB RobotStudio Final Project – IRB 1090 Motion Programming

This project was completed for the final lab in the **Automation and Robotics** course at the University of South Florida. The goal was to simulate robotic motion using ABB’s **RobotStudio** environment and program the IRB 1090 robot using the **RAPID** language.

## Project Overview

Using the FlexPendant interface, our team created a motion program that guides the IRB 1090 through 10 defined `robotargets`. Each movement was programmed with a specific:

- **Target point** (position & orientation)
- **Speed** (v500, v600, v800)
- **Zone** (fine or blending: z5–z30)
- **Tool** (tool0)

Movements used include:
- `MoveJ`: Joint interpolation
- `MoveL`: Linear path movement
